# 1.2 URLify

## Description
Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficent space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string.  

## Hints
53. It's often easiest to modify strings by going from the end of the string to the beginning.  
118. You might find you need to know the number of spaces. Can you count them?
